*Projections are based on current home run pace and a 162-game regular season. For players with fewer than 10 games played,
the projected total is capped at their current home runs due to limited data, as projections can be highly unreliable.
This chart only includes players who have played in at least 70% of the Detroit Tigers' games played so far this season.
The black tick mark on each bar indicates the projected home run total at the halfway point of the season (81 games).
Actual results may vary due to performance fluctuations, injuries, and other factors.
Batting order information is not available in the current data.
